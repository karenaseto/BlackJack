# BlackJack
This is a personal project that I created using PyGame and Python. This isn't finished but I hope that you have some fun with it! This project started when I was reminiscing about the card games I used to play as a child and realized how much fun it would be if there was an online variation of it that doesn't require using the internet. I started most of the base code as a final project in my Python class at school but I wanted it to be more than a terminal game. Although this is only a one player game, the dealer is always there and prevents you from taking too much of a risk.

Future Plans
1. Make the entire project run through the same display that my game runs through. Since there's still some part of the project that requires the terminal, I plan to add those options to the display screen.
2. I plan to add a "gambling" aspect into the game that's not using real money but using a fake currency that's for the game only.
