# BlackJack
This is a personal project that we created using PyGame and Python. This isn't finished but we hope that you have some fun with it! This project started when we were reminiscing about the card games we used to play as a child and realized how much fun it would be if there was an online variation of it that doesn't require using the internet. Karena started most of the base code as a final project in her Python class at school but we worked together so it wouldn't only be a terminal game but a game with graphics and a display that shows the actual cards. Although this is only a one player game, the dealer is always there and prevents you from taking too much of a risk.

Future Plans
1. Make the entire project run through the same display that my game runs through. Since there's still some part of the project that requires the terminal, we plan to add those options to the display screen.
2. We plan to add a "gambling" aspect into the game that's not using real money but using a fake currency that's for the game only.
