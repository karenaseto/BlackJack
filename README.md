This is a personal project that I created using PyGame. This isn't finished but I hope that you have some fun with it! This project started during my CIS012 class at PCC but there's a lot that I added to it on the side. I've implemented PyGame so the code doesn't only run in the terminal. I'm planning on adding more details to this project. 

Future Plans
1. Make the entire project run through the same display that my game runs through. Since there's still some part of the project that requires the terminal, I plan to add those options to the display screen.
2. I plan to add a "gambling" aspect into the game that's not using real money but using a fake currency that's for the game only.
